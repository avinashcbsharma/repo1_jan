    <h2><u>History</u></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The history of Sydney is the story of the peoples of the land that has become modern Sydney.
        Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 30,000 years, and Aboriginal 
        engravings and cultural sites are common in the Sydney area. The traditional owners of the land on
        which modern Sydney stands are the Darug, Dharawal and Eora people.The modern history of the city 
        began with the arrival of a First Fleet of British ships in 1788 and the foundation of a penal colony 
        by Great Britain.        
        From 1788 to 1900, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of New South Wales. The town of Sydney 
        was declared a city in 1842, and a local government was established. In 1901, the Australian colonies 
        federated to become the Commonwealth of Australia, and Sydney became the capital of the state of 
        New South Wales. Sydney today is Australia's largest city and a major international centre of culture 
        and finance. The city has played host to numerous international events, including the 2000 Summer Olympics.

    <p class="midfnt">Sydney, city, capital of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Located on Australia's southeastern coast, 
        Sydney is the country's largest city and, with its magnificent harbour and strategic position, is one of 
        the most important ports in the South Pacific. In the early 19th century, when it was still a small convict 
        settlement and the first settlers had barely penetrated the interior, it had already established trade with 
        the Pacific Islands, India, China, South Africa, and the Americas.
        Freeman, Sir Ralph: Sydney Harbour Bridge
        
        Sydney Harbour Bridge, designed by Sir Ralph Freeman, in Port Jackson, New South Wales, Australia.
        The first sight of Sydney, whether from the sea or the air, is always spectacular. Built on low hills surrounding 
        a huge harbour with innumerable bays and inlets, the city is dominated by the bulk of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 
        one of the longest steel-arch bridges in the world, and the Opera House, with its glittering white shell-shaped 
        roofs that seem to echo the sails of the many yachts in the adjacent harbour. The intricate confusion of water 
        and buildings makes a striking impression either by day or by night.

        Port Jackson is the natural harbour of Sydney. It is known for its natural environment, and as the location of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The area around the harbour foreshore contains pockets of bushland which was once common around Sydney, containing a range of native animals.
    </p>
        <p><b>Sydney Opera House</b>

        The Sydney Opera House is one of the most distinctive and famous 20th-century buildings, and one of the most famous performing arts venues in the world. Situated on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour, with parkland to its south and close to the equally famous Sydney Harbour Bridge, the building and its surroundings form an iconic Australian image.

        The building was included in the Olympic Torch route in 2000 to the Sydney Olympic Stadium. It was the backdrop of some events for the 2000 Summer Olympics, including the triathlon—which began at the Opera House—and the yachting events on Sydney Harbour. The dramatic exteriors have not been matched with technically superior interiors, and the Opera House's reputation as a music venue has suffered as a result.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p><b> Sydney Harbour Bridge</b>
        Sydney Harbour on New Year's Eve

        The Sydney Harbour Bridge is the main crossing of Sydney Harbour carrying rail, vehicular, and pedestrian traffic between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and the North Shore. The dramatic water vista of the bridge together with the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of both Sydney and Australia. The South-east pylon for many years operated as lookout and tourist attraction, containing a number of telescopes and antiquated arcade games which operated on pennies, long after that currency had gone out of operation. The pylon has recently been renovated and returned to its tourist function.[4]
    </p>
    <p><b> Bridge Climb</b> <br>

        Since 1998, BridgeClimb[5] has made it possible for tourists to climb the southern half of the bridge. Tours run throughout the day, from dawn to dusk and are only cancelled for electrical storms or high wind. Night climbs are also available. Groups of climbers are provided with protective clothing appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions and are given an orientation before climbing. During the climb, attendees are secured to the bridge by a wire lifeline. Each climb begins on the eastern side of the bridge and ascends to the top. At the summit, the group crosses to the western side of the arch for the descent. Each climb is a three-and-a-half-hour experience.
    </p>
    <p><b>Historic forts</b><br>

        The shores of Sydney Harbour are home to a number of historic batteries, bunkers and forts, many of which are now heritage listed. Some of these forts date back to 1871 and were part of Sydney Harbours defence system that was designed to withstand a seaborn attack. There are four historical fortifications located between Bradleys Head and Middle Head on the north side of the harbour; the Middle Head Fortifications, the Georges Head Battery, the Lower Georges Heights Commanding Position and a small fort located on Bradleys Head. The forts were constructed from mostly large sandstone blocks and consist of many tunnels, catacombs and underground rooms.[6]
    </p>
    <p><b>Watsons Bay</b><br>    
        Camp Cove beach on Watsons Bay

        Watsons Bay sits on the end of the South Head peninsula and takes its name from the sheltered bay and anchorage on its western side, in Port Jackson. It provides some of the best views across the harbour to the city of Sydney and the Harbour Bridge.|The Gap is an ocean cliff on the eastern side with views to Manly, North Head and the Pacific Ocean.

        Watsons Bay is a mostly residential area with some recreational areas and beaches, including one legal nude beach. Some restaurants, cafes and the Watsons Bay Hotel are located here, with Doyles on the Beach, one of the Sydney's most famous seafood restaurants, located on the foreshore of Watsons Bay.[citation needed] The naval base HMAS Watson is located nearby at South Head.

<h2 id="People" ><u>People of Sydney</u></h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Sydney was founded by the British, and the largest proportion of its citizens is still of British stock, 
    if that term is extended to include persons of Irish descent. In the period after World War II, however, 
    Australia took in large numbers of immigrants from other European countries and from Asia, including people 
    of Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, and Vietnamese origins. New Zealand also provides a large number of 
    immigrants. Many of these newcomers settled in Sydney. Some of the inner suburbs have a distinctly Greek or 
    Italian character, and almost every suburb has its variety of ethnic restaurants. There is a Chinatown, and 
    one suburb, Redfern, has a small community of Aboriginals living under somewhat depressed conditions.
